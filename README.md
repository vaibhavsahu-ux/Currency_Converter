# Currency Converter

A simple Python project to convert amounts between different currencies using hardcoded exchange rates (for now).

## Limitations
1. Can only convert between INR, USD & EUR

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the code.
3. Run the script
4. Make sure you input INR, USD or EUR when asked for the conversion currency inputs

## Future Improvements
1. Integrate with a real exchange rate API for live data.
2. Add support for more currencies.
